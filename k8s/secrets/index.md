# Secrets

Remember that secrets encode data in base64 format. Anyone with the base64 encoded secret can easily decode it. As such the secrets can be considered as not very safe.

The concept of safety of the Secrets is a bit confusing in Kubernetes. The kubernetes documentation page and a lot of blogs out there refer to secrets as a "safer option" to store sensitive data. They are safer than storing in plain text as they reduce the risk of accidentally exposing passwords and other sensitive data. In my opinion it's not the secret itself that is safe, it is the practices around it.

Secrets are not encrypted, so it is not safer in that sense. However, some best practices around using secrets make it safer. As in best practices like:

- Not checking-in secret object definition files to source code repositories. 
- Enabling Encryption at Rest for Secrets so they are stored encrypted in ETCD.
